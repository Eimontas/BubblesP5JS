This is a simple image processing tool (P5.js) that I created for a graphic design job.

BACKGROUND 

The task was to replicate the idea from the reference.png image but to make it seamless.
After battling with Photoshop to get a random pattern to repeat at the sides, top and bottom - I decided to create my own bespoke tool that can do exactly what I need it to.

Please see 'result.png' for the resulting image.

USAGE

Press the spacebar to toggle the cursor On/ Off.
The colours will repeat on a loop (Purple, Red, Green, Orange, Yellow and Blue), 
while the size is randomly generated after placement of any bubble (ellipse width: 100-200px, ellipse height: 0.8 - 1.8 W/H ratio).

While the cursor is 'Off' you may right click for further options, otherwise the tool will register a click and place an ellipse.
